(padded with zeros if \u003c 8)\n    ],\n    'swarms': [                # Closest 5 swarms\n        {'distance': float, 'angle': float, 'state': str},\n    ],\n    'obstacles': [             # Closest 3 obstacles\n        {'distance': float, 'angle': float, 'core_distance': float},\n    ],\n    'players': [               # Closest 5 other players (for Stage 2+)\n        {'distance': float, 'angle': float, 'stage': int},\n    ],\n}\n```\n\n**Observation Design Notes:**\n- Relative positions (distance/angle) instead of absolute (translation invariant)\n- Fixed-size arrays (neural nets need consistent input shape)\n- Normalized values (helps training stability)\n- Sorted by relevance (closest entities matter most)\n\n### Action Space (What AI Can Do)\n\n**Stage 1 (Single-Cell):**\n```python\naction = {\n    'move_x': float,  # -1 to +1 (continuous)\n    'move_y': float,  # -1 to +1 (continuous)\n}\n```\n\n**Stage 2+ (Multi-Cell):**\n```python\naction = {\n    'move_x': float,\n    'move_y': float,\n    'pseudopod_extend': bool,      # Whether to extend pseudopod\n    'pseudopod_target_x': float,   # -1 to +1 (relative to agent)\n    'pseudopod_target_y': float,\n}\n```\n\n### Reward Function (What Makes AI Good)\n\n**Stage 1 Survival:**\n```python\nreward = 0\n\n# Survival bonus\nreward += 0.01 * dt  # Small reward per second alive\n\n# Nutrient collection\nif nutrient_collected:\n    reward += 1.0 + (nutrient_value / 100)  # Bonus for high-value nutrients\n    \n# Evolution milestone\nif evolved:\n    reward += 5.0\n    \n# Death penalty\nif died:\n    reward -= 10.0\n    \n# Efficiency incentives\nreward -= 0.0001 * distance_to_nearest_nutrient  # Encourage seeking\nreward -= 0.001 if in_danger_zone else 0  # Penalize risky positions\n\n# Energy management\nif energy \u003c 0.2:  # Low energy is dangerous\n    reward -= 0.01 * dt\n```\n\n**Reward Shaping Notes:**\n- Dense rewards (frequent small signals) train faster than sparse (rare big signals)\n- Magnitude matters (death = -10, alive = +0.01 means \"don't die\" is priority)\n- Can tune to encourage specific behaviors (risk-taking, efficiency, exploration)\n\n### ML Stack\n\n```\nPython Environment:\n├─ Python 3.10+\n├─ PyTorch 2.0+ (neural net framework)\n├─ Stable Baselines3 (pre-built RL algorithms: PPO, DQN, SAC)\n├─ Gymnasium (environment interface standard)\n├─ NumPy (array operations)\n└─ Matplotlib / TensorBoard (training visualization)\n\nTraining Infrastructure:\n├─ Training script (runs episodes, logs metrics)\n├─ Model checkpointing (save best agents)\n├─ Hyperparameter configs (learning rate, network size, etc.)\n└─ Evaluation script (test trained agent performance)\n\nVisualization:\n├─ TensorBoard for training curves (reward over time, loss, etc.)\n├─ Game client to watch trained agent play live\n└─ Episode recordings (save interesting runs)\n```\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Single-Agent Stage 1 Survival (MVP)\n**Goal:** Prove concept - train a neural net to survive as single-cell\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Build Gymnasium environment wrapper for GODCELL\n2. Define observation space (agent state + nearby entities)\n3. Define action space (movement only)\n4. Implement reward function (survival, collection, death)\n5. Set up training loop with PPO algorithm\n6. Train agent for ~100k episodes (~few hours on laptop)\n7. Evaluate: Watch agent play in game client\n8. Iterate on reward shaping until behavior is interesting\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Agent learns to collect nutrients consistently\n- Agent avoids gravity wells and swarms\n- Agent survives longer than random actions\n- Agent reaches Stage 2 evolution\n\n**Estimated Effort:** ~1 week (with me coding, you tweaking rewards)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Python training script\n- Trained model file (.pth or .pkl)\n- Integration to load trained agent into game server\n- Metrics/graphs showing learning progress\n\n### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Competition\n**Goal:** Train multiple agents simultaneously, competing for resources\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Modify environment to support multiple agents in same world\n2. Update observation space to include other agents\n3. Train agents together (they compete for scarce nutrients)\n4. Observe emergent strategies (territory, avoidance, aggression?)\n5. Self-play training (agents get smarter as competition improves)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Agents develop distinct strategies\n- Agents respond to other agents' presence\n- Competitive dynamics emerge (chasing, fleeing, claiming areas)\n\n**Estimated Effort:** ~3-4 days\n\n**Emergent Behaviors to Look For:**\n- Territory claiming (agents stake out regions)\n- Avoidance (fleeing from stronger agents)\n- Herding (multiple agents coordinating?)\n- Resource prediction (going where nutrients will spawn)\n\n### Phase 3: Predator-Prey Adversarial Training\n**Goal:** Train Stage 2 agents to hunt Stage 1 prey\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Update action space for Stage 2 (pseudopod extension)\n2. Implement predator reward function (energy from hunting)\n3. Implement prey reward function (survival against predators)\n4. Adversarial training loop (predator and prey improve together)\n5. Curriculum learning (start with dumb prey, increase difficulty)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Predators learn to use pseudopods effectively\n- Predators learn pursuit strategies (cut off escape routes, ambush)\n- Prey learns evasion strategies (unpredictable movement, using obstacles)\n- Arms race dynamics (both keep improving)\n\n**Estimated Effort:** ~5-7 days\n\n**Advanced Techniques:**\n- Population-based training (multiple predator/prey variants)\n- Behavioral diversity rewards (encourage varied strategies)\n- Save \"hall of fame\" opponents (train against past best agents)\n\n### Phase 4: Deployment as Game Bots\n**Goal:** Export trained models as \"hard mode\" AI opponents\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Serialize trained models for production use\n2. Build inference pipeline (load model, run predictions in game)\n3. Optimize for real-time performance (fast forward pass)\n4. Add difficulty settings (use partially-trained vs fully-trained models)\n5. Package as optional \"ML bots\" vs current steering behavior bots\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Trained agents run at 60fps in production server\n- Players can toggle ML bots on/off\n- ML bots provide genuinely challenging gameplay\n- Model files are small enough to deploy (\u003c10MB)\n\n**Estimated Effort:** ~3 days\n\n**Deployment Options:**\n- Ship models with game (bundle .pth files)\n- Load from CDN (update models without redeploying)\n- Server-side inference only (clients see results, not model)\n\n## Technical Challenges \u0026 Solutions\n\n### Challenge 1: Training Speed\n- **Problem:** Cross-process communication (Python ↔ Node) is slow\n- **Solution:** Vectorized environments (run 16 game instances in parallel)\n- **Solution:** Port core logic to Python if needed (10-100x speedup)\n- **Solution:** Use GPU for neural net inference (PyTorch CUDA)\n\n### Challenge 2: Reward Shaping\n- **Problem:** Agent finds exploits (sits in corner, farms one spot)\n- **Solution:** Iterative reward tuning (penalize boring behavior)\n- **Solution:** Curriculum learning (start easy, increase difficulty)\n- **Solution:** Behavioral cloning (train on human demonstrations first)\n\n### Challenge 3: Non-Stationarity\n- **Problem:** Game state changes as agent learns (other agents adapt)\n- **Solution:** Self-play (agents train against copies of themselves)\n- **Solution:** Population-based training (diverse opponent pool)\n\n### Challenge 4: Observation Design\n- **Problem:** Too much info → slow training, too little → can't learn\n- **Solution:** Start minimal, add observations incrementally\n- **Solution:** Attention mechanisms (let network focus on relevant entities)\n\n## Learning Resources\n\n**For Understanding (optional, I'll handle implementation):**\n- Spinning Up in Deep RL (OpenAI) - Best conceptual intro\n- Stable Baselines3 Docs - Practical RL library\n- Gymnasium Docs - Environment interface standard\n- PPO Paper - Algorithm we'll use\n\n**For Debugging:**\n- TensorBoard visualization (is it learning?)\n- Episode recordings (what is it doing?)\n- Reward decomposition (where are points coming from?)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Phase 1 Success:**\n- Average survival time \u003e 2 minutes\n- Evolution rate \u003e 50% of episodes\n- Nutrient collection rate \u003e current bots\n- Avoids 90%+ of singularity cores\n\n**Phase 2 Success:**\n- Emergent competitive behavior visible\n- Agents develop distinct strategies\n- Resource distribution becomes non-uniform (territory)\n\n**Phase 3 Success:**\n- Predator hunting success rate \u003e 30%\n- Prey escape success rate \u003e 40%\n- Both improve over training time\n\n**Phase 4 Success:**\n- Players report ML bots are challenging\n- Inference runs at \u003c5ms per action (60fps capable)\n- Model size \u003c5MB (deployable)\n\n## Future Extensions (Beyond Epic)\n\n- **Imitation Learning:** Train on human player replays\n- **Hierarchical RL:** High-level strategy + low-level execution\n- **Multi-objective:** Optimize for survival AND entertainment\n- **Explainability:** Visualize what neural net is \"thinking\"\n- **Online Learning:** Agents continue learning from live gameplay\n- **Evolution Sim:** Let agents evolve strategies over generations\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThis epic transforms GODCELL from \"game with AI\" to \"AI research platform disguised as game.\" We're not just making smarter bots - we're discovering what optimal play looks like in an emergent system.\n\nIf agents discover strategies we never designed (edge-running, ambush hunting, resource prediction), that validates the depth of the game design. If they find exploits, that's valuable balance feedback.\n\nPlus: You learn ML/RL through a project you actually care about. Way better than MNIST digits or CartPole.\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. **Phase 1** (1 week) - Proves concept, validates approach\n2. **Evaluate** - Is this interesting? Continue or shelve?\n3. **Phase 2** (3-4 days) - Multi-agent if Phase 1 succeeds\n4. **Phase 3** (5-7 days) - Predator-prey if competitive dynamics are cool\n5. **Phase 4** (3 days) - Deploy if we want ML bots in production\n\nStart with Phase 1, decide at each milestone if it's worth continuing.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-20T19:57:41.36976-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-20T19:57:41.36976-05:00","source_repo":"."}

Edit `GAME_CONFIG` in shared/index.ts\n2. Restart server\n3. Test in-game\n4. Repeat\n\nThis is slow and breaks flow during creative iteration.\n\n## The Solution\nWeb-based dev panel with live parameter tweaking and visual debugging tools.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### Phase 1: Live Config Tweaking (MVP)\n- Web UI overlay on game client (toggleable with `?dev` URL param)\n- Organized sliders/inputs for GAME_CONFIG values\n- Categories: Movement, Evolution, AI, Spawning, Combat\n- Changes sent to server via Socket.io, applied immediately\n- No restart needed - values update in running game\n- Export button to dump current config (copy to clipboard)\n\n### Phase 2: Visual Debugging\n- Click entities to inspect state (health, energy, AI state, velocity)\n- Toggle visualization overlays:\n  - Collision boxes (hitbox radius)\n  - Detection ranges (chemical sensing, swarm detection)\n  - Gravity wells (influence zones, event horizons, cores)\n  - AI pathfinding (where bots are seeking/fleeing)\n  - Velocity vectors (movement direction/speed)\n- Pause/resume game loop\n- Step through ticks one at a time\n\n### Phase 3: Entity Manipulation\n- Click-to-spawn entities (nutrients, obstacles, swarms)\n- Drag to reposition entities\n- Delete entities by clicking\n- Quick test scenarios (spawn predator near prey, etc.)\n- Godmode toggle (invincibility, infinite energy)\n\n### Phase 4: Configuration Management\n- Save/load preset configurations\n- Named presets: \"Stage 1 Testing\", \"Multi-cell Predation\", \"Performance Test\"\n- Store in localStorage\n- Export/import as JSON files\n- Reset to defaults button\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Server Side\n```\nserver/src/dev.ts - Dev mode utilities\n├─ Socket.io event: 'dev:updateConfig'\n├─ Validates changes before applying\n├─ Broadcasts config updates to all clients\n└─ Only active when NODE_ENV=development\n```\n\n### Client Side\n```\nclient/src/dev/DevPanel.ts - Main dev panel UI\n├─ Uses tweakpane.js or lil-gui (lightweight)\n├─ Fetches GAME_CONFIG on load\n├─ Sends updates via Socket.io\n├─ Organized folder structure by category\n└─ Toggleable with ?dev URL param\n\nclient/src/dev/DebugVisualizer.ts - Visual overlays\n├─ Renders collision boxes, ranges, vectors\n├─ Entity inspector on click\n└─ Integrates with ThreeRenderer\n```\n\n### Shared\n```\nUpdate GAME_CONFIG to be mutable at runtime\nAdd dev message types to shared/index.ts\n```\n\n## Benefits\n- 10x faster iteration on game tuning\n- Visual feedback while tweaking values\n- No context-switching (dev panel in same window as game)\n- Easier to find \"feel\" of mechanics\n- Debugging AI behaviors becomes visual\n- Can test edge cases quickly (spawn 50 swarms, etc.)\n\n## Architecture Considerations\n- Dev panel only loads in development mode\n- Zero impact on production build\n- Config changes are ephemeral (not saved to file automatically)\n- Must manually export and update GAME_CONFIG when you find good values\n- Security: Dev endpoints only respond in NODE_ENV=development\n\n## Future Enhancements (Beyond Epic)\n- Timeline/playback (record game session, scrub through)\n- Performance profiling (entity counts, frame times)\n- Network traffic visualization\n- AI behavior trees visualization\n- Level/scene editor (if we add pre-designed content later)\n\n## Implementation Order\n1. Phase 1 (Live Config) - Core value prop, 2-3 hours\n2. Phase 2 (Visual Debug) - Massive debugging help, 1-2 days\n3. Phase 4 (Presets) - Quality of life, ~4 hours\n4.

They break the immersion of the digital ocean aesthetic.\n\n**Current State:**\n- Traditional rectangular bars in top-left corner\n- Text display of exact values (69/100, etc.)\n- Static, utilitarian UI elements\n- Feels like a placeholder\n\n**Vision:**\nIntegrate health/energy feedback directly into the game world in a more organic, visually interesting way that fits the cyber-cell aesthetic.\n\n**Possible Directions:**\n1. **Cell Visual State**: Health/energy reflected in the player sprite itself\n   - Color intensity/saturation\n   - Glow brightness\n   - Particle density in trail\n   - Size pulsing\n   \n2. **Ambient Indicators**: Environmental cues\n   - Screen vignette darkening when low health\n   - Color grading shifts\n   - Particle field around player\n   - Aura/field effect\n\n3. **Organic Meters**: If we keep meter-like elements, make them fit the world\n   - Circular energy ring around player\n   - DNA helix-style indicator\n   - Orbiting data fragments\n   - Membrane thickness/integrity visual\n\n4. **Hybrid**: Combine multiple subtle cues\n   - Cell glow for energy level\n   - Screen effects for critical health\n   - No exact numbers, just visual feel\n\n**Design Goals:**\n- Maintain critical information (player needs to know when they're in danger)\n- Enhance immersion rather than breaking it\n- Fit the cyber/digital ocean aesthetic\n- Make the game world feel more alive and reactive\n- Reduce UI chrome, increase diegetic feedback\n\n**Implementation Considerations:**\n- Must be clear enough for gameplay decisions\n- Should work at a glance during intense moments\n- Accessibility: colorblind-friendly if using color cues\n- Performance: no expensive shaders if we learned anything from the nutrient glow incident\n\n**Questions to Explore:**\n- Do we need exact numbers at all, or just relative sense of fullness?\n- Can the countdown timer stay? (It's thematic and works well)\n- Should health and energy be visually distinct, or blend together?\n- What feels most \"cyber-organism in digital ocean\"?","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-19T11:16:29.441578-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-19T11:16:29.441578-05:00","source_repo":"."}
