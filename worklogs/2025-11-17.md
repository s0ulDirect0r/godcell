# Worklog - November 17, 2025

## Project Genesis: GODCELL

### Initial Vision
Started the day wanting to experiment with emergent creativity - building software like making art rather than following rigid specs. The goal: create a lo-fi MMO by Saturday for a demo.

### Tech Stack Exploration (Morning)

**Rust/Bevy Experiment:**
- Installed Rust and Bevy
- Built minimal test: two colored squares, one movable with arrow keys
- Compilation time: ~1m23s initial, 10-20s incremental
- **Decision Point:** Loved the visual output, but recognized deployment complexity (WASM + browser restrictions) and code readability challenges for explaining to others

**Pivot to TypeScript/Phaser/Node.js:**
- Primary factors: web deployment ease, code readability, instant iteration
- With AI assistance handling implementation complexity, chose stack optimized for:
  - Understanding/explaining the code
  - Fast testing/iteration loops
  - Trivial web deployment

### Project Setup

**Repository & Structure:**
- Created GitHub repo: `s0ulDirect0r/lofi-mmo`
- Monorepo structure with workspaces:
  - `client/` - Phaser game (TypeScript + Vite)
  - `server/` - Node.js + Socket.io
  - `shared/` - Common types and constants
- Set up Beads (bd) for issue tracking
- Created CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md for AI collaboration guidelines

**Core Multiplayer Implementation:**
- Real-time player synchronization via Socket.io
- Server-authoritative movement (60fps game loop)
- Smooth client-side interpolation with Phaser tweens
- Frame-rate independent movement
- Successfully tested with multiple browser tabs

**Initial PR:**
- Branch: `feat/typescript-multiplayer-game`
- Merged to main
- Basic movement working, clean codebase established

## The Vision: GODCELL

### Concept Emergence
Mid-afternoon breakthrough - the game isn't just a "lo-fi MMO," it's **GODCELL**: a game of transcendence and evolution.

**Core Concept:**
- Players start as single-celled cyber-organisms
- Not biological cells - digital beings, living bytes, data made conscious
- Journey: Simple → Complex → Transcendent
- Endgame: Merge with/become "the godcell" (exact nature TBD - discovery through play)

**Evolution Trajectory:**
1. **Beginning:** Single cyber-cell, simple movement
2. **Mid-game:** Multicellular complexity, new abilities/forms
3. **Late-game:** Transcending physical planes, existing in higher dimensions
4. **Apotheosis:** The godcell - unity/transcendence/something beyond

### First World: Digital Primordial Soup

**Branch:** `feat/godcell-digital-primordial-soup`

**Aesthetic:**
- Tron meets microscopic life
- Deep void background (#0a0a14 - almost black with blue tint)
- Subtle grid pattern (digital space structure)
- 150 flowing cyan particles creating "digital water"
- Neon color palette: cyan, magenta, yellow, mint, hot pink, lime, electric blue

**Visual Implementation:**
- Players rendered as glowing circular cells (not squares)
- Each cell has colored outline + glow effect
- Player's own cell pulses with breathing animation
- Particles flow diagonally creating drift/current sensation
- Larger world (1200x800 vs original 800x600)

**Technical Details:**
- Particle system: 150 sprites with individual velocities
- Wrap-around behavior for endless flow effect
- Grid rendered with Graphics API (50px spacing, 15% opacity)
- Frame-rate independent particle movement
- Depth layering: Grid (-100) → Particles (-50) → Players (0)

## What's Working

✅ Multiplayer synchronization
✅ Real-time movement with smooth interpolation
✅ Digital ocean aesthetic (particles + grid)
✅ Cyber-cell visual identity
✅ Scalable server architecture (60fps tick rate)
✅ Clean, readable, well-documented codebase
✅ Web-deployable architecture (ready for fly.io)

## What's Next

**Immediate (This Week):**
- [ ] Add gameplay element (nutrient collection? cell growth? interaction mechanic?)
- [ ] Chat system for player communication
- [ ] Deploy to fly.io for external testing
- [ ] Polish: particle effects, cell animations, visual feedback

**Near-term (Game Design):**
- [ ] Define progression/evolution mechanics
- [ ] First "growth" milestone - what changes?
- [ ] Resource/nutrient system
- [ ] Cell-to-cell interactions

**Future (Vision):**
- [ ] Multiple planes/dimensions as evolution stages
- [ ] Visual transformation as cells evolve
- [ ] Emergent social dynamics between cells
- [ ] Discovery of what "the godcell" actually means

## Key Decisions & Learnings

**1. Felt Experience Over Speculation**
- Ran Rust/Bevy experiment to make informed decision rather than theorizing
- Time-boxed exploration (1-2 hours) gave concrete data
- Recognized when to pivot based on real constraints

**2. Optimize for Human Constraints, Not Code Generation**
- With AI handling implementation, bottleneck is understanding/explaining
- Chose TypeScript for readability over Rust for type safety
- Iteration speed matters more than compile-time guarantees

**3. Embrace Emergent Vision**
- Started with "lo-fi MMO" → discovered "GODCELL"
- Let the aesthetic inform the concept
- Vision clarified through building, not pre-planning

**4. Readable Code as Priority**
- Extensive comments explaining "why" not just "what"
- Clear naming (createCyberCell, updateDataParticles)
- Organized sections with visual separators
- Code should be demo-able/explainable

---

## Collaboration Notes

**AI/LLM Workflow Updates:**
- Updated global CLAUDE.md with LLM capabilities section
- Emphasis: evaluate based on human constraints (understanding, deployment) not code volume
- Added readability requirements as top priority
- Established pattern: AI generates large amounts of clean, well-documented code

**Issue Tracking:**
- Using Beads (bd) for all task management
- Closed: Tech stack selection, basic server, basic client, movement sync
- In Progress: Digital primordial soup world
- Open: Chat system, gameplay elements

## Vibe Check

This feels right. The shift from "generic MMO" to "GODCELL - digital organisms evolving toward transcendence" unlocked something. The aesthetic is hitting - flowing particles, glowing cells, the sense of drifting through digital space.

Building with emergent creativity is working. Let the game tell us what it wants to be.

Next session: add some juice, make cells feel alive, add reason to interact.
